# Rock-paper-scissor-game
Hey, I tried making a simple Rock, Paper and Scissor game using python libraries such as "Tkinter" and "Pillow".

# Tkinter
tkinter is the most commonly used GUI (Graphical User Interface) method in python.


# Pillow (pip install Pillow) //[Source - docs.python.org]
Pillow is the friendly PIL fork by Alex Clark and Contributors. PIL is the Python Imaging Library by Fredrik Lundh and Contributors. As of 2019, Pillow development is supported by Tidelift.
The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.
This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.
The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.
